Let customers request a quote instead of buying directly, ideal for B2B and made-to-order.

== Description ==

Estimate turns WooCommerce products into quote requests. On quote-enabled
products it swaps the add-to-cart button for an **Add to quote** button, and can
hide the price as well. Customers collect the products they want into a quote
list and send their details through a short request form. Each submission is
emailed to you and saved as a private record you can open in wp-admin.

It suits B2B stores, wholesale, bulk orders and made-to-order products where
prices are negotiated rather than fixed.

The plugin isn't on WordPress.org yet. The code, releases and issue tracker
live on GitHub: https://github.com/wppoland/plogins-estimate; bug reports and pull
requests are welcome there.

= Documentation and links =

= Features =

* Two quote modes: enable quotes for **selected products** or for **all products**.
* Per-product toggle in the product editor (selected mode).
* Replaces the add-to-cart button with an **Add to quote** button on product pages and listings.
* Optionally hides the price on quote-enabled products.
* Per-visitor quote list stored in a cookie, so logged-out shoppers can use it without an account.
* A `[estimate_quote]` shortcode that shows the quote list and a request form (name, email, company, message).
* Quantity editing and per-item removal on the quote page.
* On submit, emails the recipient you set and saves the request as a private custom post type.
* Configurable recipient email and storefront button text.
* The add-to-quote flow works without JavaScript; the markup uses labels and ARIA attributes and reflows on small screens.
* Ships with a POT file for translation, plus a Polish (pl_PL) translation.
* Declares HPOS and cart/checkout blocks compatibility.
* On delete, removes its own options; saved quote requests are kept so a reinstall doesn't lose them.

= The [estimate_quote] shortcode =

Create a page (e.g. "Request a Quote") and add the shortcode:

`[estimate_quote]`

The page shows the current quote list and the request form. When the list is
empty it shows a short message with a link back to the shop instead.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/estimate`, or install via Plugins → Add New.
2. Activate it. WooCommerce must be active.
3. Go to **WooCommerce → Estimate** and choose your quote mode and options.
4. Create a page with the `[estimate_quote]` shortcode to host the quote list and request form.
5. In "selected" mode, edit a product and tick **Enable quote requests** in the Product data box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require WooCommerce? =

Yes. WooCommerce must be installed and active.

= Where do quote requests go? =

Each submission is emailed to the recipient you set (or the site admin email by
default) and saved as a private "Quote Request" record under the WooCommerce
menu in wp-admin.

= Can I enable quotes for only some products? =

Yes. Set the quote mode to "Selected products only" and tick **Enable quote
requests** on each product you want. Choose "All products" to apply it store-wide.

= Does the quote list work for logged-out visitors? =

Yes. The list is stored in a cookie per visitor, so no account is required.

= Can I hide prices on quote-enabled products? =

Yes. Estimate can hide product prices while shoppers build a quote list and submit a request.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Add to quote button replacing add-to-cart on a product.
2. The quote page: list, quantities and the request form.
3. The Estimate settings screen under WooCommerce.
4. A saved quote request in wp-admin.

== External Services ==

This plugin does not connect to, send data to, or load anything from any external service. Everything runs on your own site. Quote requests are saved locally as private `estimate_quote` posts with the customer's details (name, email, company and chosen items) kept in `_estimate_*` post meta, the per-product opt-in lives in the `_estimate_quote_enabled` meta key, and settings are stored in the `estimate_settings` option. Shoppers' in-progress quote lists are held in a first-party cookie on your domain, not on any third-party server. When a quote is submitted, the notification email is sent through WordPress's own `wp_mail()` to the recipient you configure (the site admin email by default); no other delivery service is involved. The bundled CSS and JavaScript are served from the plugin folder, with no remote CDN, fonts, maps or analytics.
